            <h2>1. Protect Your Password</h2>
            <p>Your password is the gateway to your account. Follow these guidelines to keep your password secure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a unique password (never reuse passwords across websites)</li>
                <li>On SignUp, avoid common and weak passwords (e.g., "123456", "password")</li>
                <li>Use a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters (e.g., CassPlaR59#Fy)</li>
                <li>Change your password periodically (At least every 2 months)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Beware of Phishing Scams</h2>
            <p>We will never ask for your login information via email, phone, or text. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited communications.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check for signs of suspicious emails (poor grammar, strange sender addresses, etc.)</li>
                <li>Verify any request through our official contact channels before acting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Payment Security</h2>
            <p>When making payments, ensure your information is protected:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Never share your full bank account details</li>
                <li>Only provide payment details through trusted, secure methods</li>
                <li>Always verify that you're paying to the correct account</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h2>
            <p>We highly recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your account to add an extra layer of security. This ensures that even if someone learns your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second verification step.</p>
